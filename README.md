# vault-express project - ALPHA stage

A simply secure sign-up/sign-in implementation for web app. You may consider this as runnable guideline for your implementation.

[LIVE DEMO](https://peaceful-peak-41153.herokuapp.com/)

This project demonstrates the secure web app by using 3 public web pages and 1 protected user profile page

**Public pages**
* /landing
* /signup
* /signin

**Protected page**
* /profile

## Why create this project?
After I went through for many programming tutorials, I thought It was time to create some web app myself.

The first thing in my head was "What should I create?" (the big question in my life) and then the next question was "Which framework should I use for frontend, backend and database?" and then again and again many questions pop into.

But a big common question for most web application that is "How can I secure the content inside my app?"

Sound easy at first for newbie as me, just create a page for sign-in. BUT the truth never be easy like that.

I did search for this topic and found scattered information spreads all over internet. Those infomation will give me wrinkles, I don't want to be an expert on this topic, I just want to create an app with acceptable secure.

Then I create this project with hope that opensource community will help me out, As always. and also to help people with the same situation as me to solve this issue.
